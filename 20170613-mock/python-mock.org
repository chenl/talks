** speaker notes

* My mother told me not to tire you too much

* Unit testing is important
Without it:
- You can't refactor
- Your productivity slows
- Your code crashes
- You loose all your hear
- And you will die!

If you listen to any of Uncle Bob Martin's talks you will here him say that some day soon lots of people are going to die due to a software bug, and it will be our fault.

* So you want to learn you a unit-test

** Didactic example

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def test_to_roman_numerals():
    assert to_roman_numerals(1949) == 'MCMXLIX'
    assert to_roman_numerals(2017) == 'MMXVII'
#+END_SRC

* Unit testing is hard

~to_roman_numerals(decial: int) -> str~ is a good boy:

It is a *pure* function. It gets a value and return a value that dependent *only* on its' input.

So you go into the real world thinking, this unit-testing thing isn't that hard and you look at:

** But int he real world it is not like that:
- legacy code
- inspects the world
- has side effects
- calls external services
- have random components

* Guessing Game the Enterprise Edition

*** request time (inspect the world)

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from datetime import datetime
import requests

def request_time():
    r = requests.get('http://now.httpbin.org/')
    if r.status_code != 200:
       raise RuntimeError("Oy Vey!")
    return datetime.strptime(r.json()['now']['iso8601'],
                             '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')
#+END_SRC

*** cmd2 (integration, mock os.system)

#+BEGIN_SRC python
>>> c = ExampleCmd()
>>> c.one_cmd_plus_hooks('shell echo a')
a
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import os

class ExampleCmd(cmd.Cmd):
    # ...
    def one_cmd_plus_hooks(self, line):
        # ...
        os.system(...)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from unittest.mock import patch

@patch('os.system')
def test_exmaple_cmd_shell(mock_system):
    c = ExampleCmd()
    c.one_cmd_plus_hooks('shell echo a')
    mock_system.assert_called_once_with('echo a')
#+END_SRC

*** get json

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def get_json(filename):
    try:
        return json.loads(open(filename).read())
    except (IOError, ValueError):
        return {}
#+END_SRC

Well... I can create a `tempfile` with some json in it. And I can put some invalid json to have the ~ValueError~, and there must be something I can do to get an ~IOError~ and I will figure this out later somehow.

But then you are writing a *functional* test.

*** credit card (side effect)

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def charge_credit_card(amount, cc_number, exp_month, exp_year):
    db = Database()
    q = OfflineQueue(db)
    ccp = CreditCardProcessor(q)
    c = CreditCard(cc_number, exp_month, exp_year)
    c.charge(ccp, amount)
#+END_SRC


* Mock makes it easy

Meat ~Mock~

He is an accommodating dude:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
m = mock.Mock()
m()  # ok
m.foo()  # ok
m.foo().bar.baz(1, 2, 3, eggs='spam')  # ok
#+END_SRC
  I am ok with that: https://unsplash.com/collections/262992/funny?photo=BXs8SjVelKs

** patch
   patches the *name* of something

* Mock makes it too easy

- it is too permissive (can be made better)
- if it is unit only, the boundaries between units aren't checked.

* One step on a long journey

- no tests
- with unit coverage
- define the boundaries you wish to mock
- define the way you want to construct your mock
